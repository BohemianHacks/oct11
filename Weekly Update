“The Nature of Truth”  
   
*Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.”* John 14:6-7  
   
I spent the first couple of days this week at a training event put on by the Missouri Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church. The event featured keynote presentations about maintaining healthy boundaries in our lives, finding hope for the future, and a “Refreshed Wesleyan Vision.”  My favorite takeaway from these speakers was the line: “You are not required to set yourself on fire to keep others warm.”  
   
In addition to these keynotes, we also had breakout workshops to attend. (True confession: when I go to events like this, my expectations for enlightenment are not very high. Having gone to similar events for the past 20+ years, I have come to temper my expectations. Especially when deciding upon workshops based upon very vague titles and descriptions.)  The first afternoon I attended a workshop titled: “Broadband: An Owner’s Manual – Learning to Master the Media So it Doesn’t Master You.” This workshop was led by a professor at the University of Missouri’s Journalism School who has spent her nearly 50 year career in seeking to report and share “truth.”  
   
Throughout her presentations (I went to her second workshop, even though I had signed up for a different one), she taught us the importance of having a healthy level of skepticism (not cynicism) when consuming news – especially news from non-traditional news sources (social media and internet-based organizations). She said that over the past 25 years, less and less news has been produced by professionals – those educated and trained in recognizing and reporting truth. She shared resources for verifying stories and facts (websites such as factcheck.org, politifact.com, and snopes.com), how to do a reverse image search to verify the authenticity of an image (such as the image going around of the young child holding the puppy in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which was AI generated), and how to find out what organization or corporation might be behind a news story or website.  
   
All of this got me thinking about the nature of truth. It’s no understatement to say that it is now harder than ever to distinguish fact from fiction. From “fake news” and “alternative facts” to “deep fakes” and “AI generated images,” we must be cautious in trusting so much of what we see. But what is the cost of this? In John 14, Jesus is talking to the disciples and assuring them of their hope in him, that in God (through Christ), we can be sure of what is true.  Jesus explicitly tells his pupils “I am the truth\!”  
   
In a time where so much gets twisted and manipulated and it feels like deception is around every corner, remember this: Jesus is the truth. When you find your soul needing affirmation of what is real and what is not, look to those words in red, look to the words of the Word, God’s Living Word, to know what is really true.  
   
Blessings, Chris

**Worship This Week**

This Sunday we move to a couple of messages about kindness and a Christian response to division and hate. This week our message is titled “Unity Amid Division.” Our Scripture focus will be from the Gospel of John, Chapter 16, verses 20-23.  
   
*“My prayer is not just for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one – I in them and you in me – so that they may be brought to complete unity. They the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.”*  
   
Our 8:00 service will begin with the song *Honestly We Just Need Jesus*, by Terrian. Our 10:20 service will begin with our Praise Band leading us in *Less Like Me*. Both services will include the songs *Mighty To Save,* followed by *The Gift of Love* and we will conclude with the song *They’ll Know We Are Christians by Our Love..*
